Overview
This Python script implements Euler's Method and Runge-Kutta Method to solve the differential equation:
dy/dt = t - y^2

It approximates the solution over a given time range with a specified number of iterations.

How to Use the Code
1. Run the script in Python 3.
2. The output will display:
   - The final approximate value using Euler's Method.
   - The final approximate value using Runge-Kutta Method.

Changing Inputs
You can modify the following parameters to experiment with different inputs.

Initial Conditions
The initial conditions for range, iterations, and initial point can be modified in this section for each method.
Current initial conditions:
Range: 0 < t < 2
Iterations: 10
Initial Point: f(0) = 1
